# Projectile Motion Simulation

This project simulates the projectile motion of an object considering both deterministic and unpredictable factors, providing insights into the effects of randomness on the trajectory of the projectile.

## Overview

Projectile motion is a fundamental concept in physics, describing the motion of an object projected into the air. This simulation incorporates randomness, such as variations in velocity and direction, to model real-world scenarios where factors like wind or changing atmospheric conditions can influence the projectile's behavior.

## Features

- **Deterministic Model:** The basic projectile motion model without randomness.
- **Randomness Factor:** Introduces a factor of unpredictability, simulating real-world variability.
- **Simulation Results:** Provides key information such as maximum height, horizontal distance, and total time of flight.

### Prerequisites

- Python installed
- Required Python packages: NumPy, Matplotlib

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/projectile-motion-simulation.git

## Usage

- Run the simulation script
  ```bash
   python ProjectileMotion.py
-Adjust simulation parameters in the script to explore different scenarios.


## Results

- Simulation results and parameters, including trajectory plots and key metrics, will be saved to text files.
